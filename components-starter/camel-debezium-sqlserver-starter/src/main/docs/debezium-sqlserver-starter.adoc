|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.column-blacklist* | Description is not available here, please check Debezium website for corresponding key 'column.blacklist' description. |  | String

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.database-history* | The name of the DatabaseHistory class that should be used to store and recover database schema changes. The configuration properties for the history are prefixed with the 'database.history.' string. | io.debezium.relational.history.FileDatabaseHistory | String

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.database-history-kafka-bootstrap-servers* | A list of host/port pairs that the connector will use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster for retrieving database schema history previously stored by the connector. This should point to the same Kafka cluster used by the Kafka Connect process. |  | String

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.database-server-name* | Unique name that identifies the database server and all recorded offsets, and that is used as a prefix for all schemas and topics. Each distinct installation should have a separate namespace and be monitored by at most one Debezium connector. |  | String

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.decimal-handling-mode* | Specify how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns should be represented in change events, including:'precise' (the default) uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'string' uses string to represent values; 'double' represents values using Java's 'double', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers. | precise | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.heartbeat-interval-ms* | Length of an interval in milli-seconds in in which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. Use 0 to disable heartbeat messages. Disabled by default. | 0 | Integer

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.max-batch-size* | Maximum size of each batch of source records. Defaults to 2048. | 2048 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.max-queue-size* | Maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size. | 8192 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.message-key-columns* | A semicolon-separated list of expressions that match fully-qualified tables and column(s) to be used as message key. Each expression must match the pattern ':',where the table names could be defined as (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector,and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration the table's primary key column(s) will be used as message key.Example: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.poll-interval-ms* | Frequency in milliseconds to wait for new change events to appear after receiving no events. Defaults to 500ms. | 500 | Long

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.snapshot-lock-timeout-ms* | The maximum number of millis to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired in this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. Defaults to 10 seconds | 10000 | Long
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.snapshot-mode* | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector should run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'schema_only' to specify the connector should run a snapshot of the schema when no offsets are available for the logical server name. | initial | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.snapshot-select-statement-overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.source-struct-version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.time-precision-mode* | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | adaptive | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.configuration.tombstones-on-delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the debezium-sqlserver component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
