:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for netty-http

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using netty-http with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-netty-http-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 36 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.netty-http.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.bridge-endpoint* | If the option is true, the producer will ignore the Exchange.HTTP_URI header, and use the endpoint's URI for request. You may also set the throwExceptionOnFailure to be false to let the producer send all the fault response back. The consumer working in the bridge mode will skip the gzip compression and WWW URL form encoding (by adding the Exchange.SKIP_GZIP_ENCODING and Exchange.SKIP_WWW_FORM_URLENCODED headers to the consumed exchange). | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.chunked-max-content-length* | Value in bytes the max content length per chunked frame received on the Netty HTTP server. | 1048576 | Integer
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.compression* | Allow using gzip/deflate for compression on the Netty HTTP server if the client supports it from the HTTP headers. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.disable-stream-cache* | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Netty HttpRequest#getContent() or HttpResponset#getContent() is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in light-weight memory based Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Netty input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream, such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. Mind that if you enable this option, then you cannot read the Netty stream multiple times out of the box, and you would need manually to reset the reader index on the Netty raw stream. Also Netty will auto-close the Netty stream when the Netty HTTP server/HTTP client is done processing, which means that if the asynchronous routing engine is in use then any asynchronous thread that may continue routing the org.apache.camel.Exchange may not be able to read the Netty stream, because Netty has closed it. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.host* | The local hostname such as localhost, or 0.0.0.0 when being a consumer. The remote HTTP server hostname when using producer. |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.log-warn-on-bad-request* | Whether Netty HTTP server should log a WARN if decoding the HTTP request failed and a HTTP Status 400 (bad request) is returned. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.map-headers* | If this option is enabled, then during binding from Netty to Camel Message then the headers will be mapped as well (eg added as header to the Camel Message as well). You can turn off this option to disable this. The headers can still be accessed from the org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpMessage message with the method getHttpRequest() that returns the Netty HTTP request io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequest instance. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.match-on-uri-prefix* | Whether or not Camel should try to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if no exact match is found. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.max-header-size* | The maximum length of all headers. If the sum of the length of each header exceeds this value, a io.netty.handler.codec.TooLongFrameException will be raised. | 8192 | Integer
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.mute-exception* | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side the response's body won't contain the exception's stack trace. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.ok-status-code-range* | The status codes which are considered a success response. The values are inclusive. Multiple ranges can be defined, separated by comma, e.g. 200-204,209,301-304. Each range must be a single number or from-to with the dash included. The default range is 200-299 | 200-299 | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.path* | Resource path |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.port* | The host port number |  | Integer
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.protocol* | The protocol to use which is either http, https or proxy - a consumer only option. |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.send503when-suspended* | Whether to send back HTTP status code 503 when the consumer has been suspended. If the option is false then the Netty Acceptor is unbound when the consumer is suspended, so clients cannot connect anymore. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.throw-exception-on-failure* | Option to disable throwing the HttpOperationFailedException in case of failed responses from the remote server. This allows you to get all responses regardless of the HTTP status code. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.transfer-exception* | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side, and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is, instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.url-decode-headers* | If this option is enabled, then during binding from Netty to Camel Message then the header values will be URL decoded (eg %20 will be a space character. Notice this option is used by the default org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding and therefore if you implement a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding then you would need to decode the headers accordingly to this option. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration.use-relative-path* | Sets whether to use a relative path in HTTP requests. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the netty-http component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.executor-service* | To use the given EventExecutorGroup. The option is a io.netty.util.concurrent.EventExecutorGroup type. |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.header-filter-strategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter headers. The option is a org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy type. |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.maximum-pool-size* | Sets a maximum thread pool size for the netty consumer ordered thread pool. The default size is 2 x cpu_core plus 1. Setting this value to eg 10 will then use 10 threads unless 2 x cpu_core plus 1 is a higher value, which then will override and be used. For example if there are 8 cores, then the consumer thread pool will be 17. This thread pool is used to route messages received from Netty by Camel. We use a separate thread pool to ensure ordering of messages and also in case some messages will block, then nettys worker threads (event loop) wont be affected. |  | Integer
| *camel.component.netty-http.netty-http-binding* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding for binding to/from Netty and Camel Message API. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding type. |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.authenticate* |  |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.constraint* |  |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.login-denied-logging-level* |  |  | LoggingLevel
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.realm* |  |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.role-class-name* |  |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.security-authenticator* |  |  | SecurityAuthenticator
| *camel.component.netty-http.security-configuration.security-constraint* |  |  | SecurityConstraint
| *camel.component.netty-http.ssl-context-parameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters. The option is a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters type. |  | String
| *camel.component.netty-http.use-global-ssl-context-parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | Boolean
