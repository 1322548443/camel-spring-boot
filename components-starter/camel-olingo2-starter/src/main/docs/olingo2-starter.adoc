:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for olingo2

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using olingo2 with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-olingo2-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 18 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.olingo2.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.olingo2.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.api-name* | What kind of operation to perform |  | Olingo2ApiName
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.connect-timeout* | HTTP connection creation timeout in milliseconds, defaults to 30,000 (30 seconds) | 30000 | Integer
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.content-type* | Content-Type header value can be used to specify JSON or XML message format, defaults to application/json;charset=utf-8 | application/json;charset=utf-8 | String
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.filter-already-seen* | Set this to true to filter out results that have already been communicated by this component. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.http-async-client-builder* | Custom HTTP async client builder for more complex HTTP client configuration, overrides connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy and sslContext. Note that a socketTimeout MUST be specified in the builder, otherwise OData requests could block indefinitely |  | HttpAsyncClientBuilder
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.http-client-builder* | Custom HTTP client builder for more complex HTTP client configuration, overrides connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy and sslContext. Note that a socketTimeout MUST be specified in the builder, otherwise OData requests could block indefinitely |  | HttpClientBuilder
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.http-headers* | Custom HTTP headers to inject into every request, this could include OAuth tokens, etc. |  | Map
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.method-name* | What sub operation to use for the selected operation |  | String
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.proxy* | HTTP proxy server configuration |  | HttpHost
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.service-uri* | Target OData service base URI, e.g. \http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc |  | String
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.socket-timeout* | HTTP request timeout in milliseconds, defaults to 30,000 (30 seconds) | 30000 | Integer
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.split-result* | For endpoints that return an array or collection, a consumer endpoint will map every element to distinct messages, unless splitResult is set to false. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.olingo2.configuration.ssl-context-parameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters |  | SSLContextParameters
| *camel.component.olingo2.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the olingo2 component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.olingo2.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.olingo2.use-global-ssl-context-parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | Boolean
