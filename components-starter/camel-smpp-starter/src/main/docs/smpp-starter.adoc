| *camel.component.smpp.configuration.splitting-policy* | You can specify a policy for handling long messages: ALLOW - the default, long messages are split to 140 bytes per message TRUNCATE - long messages are split and only the first fragment will be sent to the SMSC. Some carriers drop subsequent fragments so this reduces load on the SMPP connection sending parts of a message that will never be delivered. REJECT - if a message would need to be split, it is rejected with an SMPP NegativeResponseException and the reason code signifying the message is too long. |  | SmppSplittingPolicy

| *camel.component.smpp.configuration.transaction-timer* | Defines the maximum period of inactivity allowed after a transaction, after which an SMPP entity may assume that the session is no longer active.

| *camel.component.smpp.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the smpp component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.smpp.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
