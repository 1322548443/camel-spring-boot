== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using debezium-mongodb with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-debezium-mongodb-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.configuration.collection-blacklist* | Description is not available here, please check Debezium website for corresponding key 'collection.blacklist' description. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.configuration.collection-whitelist* | The collections for which changes are to be captured |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.configuration.connect-backoff-initial-delay-ms* | The initial delay when trying to reconnect to a primary after a connection cannot be made or when no primary is available. Defaults to 1 second (1000 ms). | 1000 | Long

| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.configuration.max-queue-size* | Maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size. | 8192 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.configuration.mongodb-hosts* | The hostname and port pairs (in the form 'host' or 'host:port') of the MongoDB server(s) in the replica set. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.configuration.mongodb-members-auto-discover* | Specifies whether the addresses in 'hosts' are seeds that should be used to discover all members of the cluster or replica set ('true'), or whether the address(es) in 'hosts' should be used as is ('false').
