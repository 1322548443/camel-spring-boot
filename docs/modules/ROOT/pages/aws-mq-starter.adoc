== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using aws-mq with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-mq-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 19 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.aws-mq.access-key* | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.amazon-mq-client* | To use a existing configured AmazonMQClient as client. The option is a com.amazonaws.services.mq.AmazonMQ type. |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.access-key* | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.amazon-mq-client* | To use a existing configured AmazonMQClient as client |  | AmazonMQ
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.operation* | The operation to perform. It can be listBrokers,createBroker,deleteBroker |  | MQOperations
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.proxy-host* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the MQ client |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.proxy-port* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the MQ client |  | Integer
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.proxy-protocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the MQ client |  | Protocol
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.region* | The region in which MQ client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.configuration.secret-key* | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the aws-mq component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.aws-mq.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.aws-mq.operation* | The operation to perform. It can be listBrokers,createBroker,deleteBroker |  | MQOperations
| *camel.component.aws-mq.proxy-host* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the MQ client |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.proxy-port* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the MQ client |  | Integer
| *camel.component.aws-mq.proxy-protocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the MQ client |  | Protocol
| *camel.component.aws-mq.region* | The region in which MQ client needs to work |  | String
| *camel.component.aws-mq.secret-key* | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
